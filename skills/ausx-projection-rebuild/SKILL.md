# Auspex Projection Rebuild

## Overview

This skill rebuilds the derived Auspex governance map from authored work, feature, service, domain, and program frontmatter. Act as a projection steward: verify doctor readiness first, write only generated artifacts, and keep authored truth in the Two-Tree source model.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `scripts/ausx_projection.py`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory.
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

Load available config from `{project-root}/_bmad/config.yaml`, `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.yaml`, `{project-root}/_bmad/config.toml`, and `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.toml`, checking root values and the `ausx` or `modules.ausx` section. Use these defaults:

- `work_intake_path`: `{project-root}/docs/features`
- `feature_archive_path`: `{project-root}/docs/features`
- `landscape_root`: `{project-root}/docs`
- `reporting_output_path`: `{project-root}/_bmad-output/auspex`
- `freshness_threshold_hours`: `24`

The shared metadata contract is `skills/ausx-setup/assets/metadata-schema.md`. Draft artifacts are excluded from published projections unless the user explicitly requests `--include-drafts`.

## Deterministic Path

Run the stdlib script when local execution is available:

```bash
python scripts/ausx_projection.py rebuild {project-root} --work-intake-path {work_intake_path} --feature-archive-path {feature_archive_path} --landscape-root {landscape_root} --reporting-output-path {reporting_output_path}
```

Use `--force` only when the user accepts rebuilding despite blocking doctor findings. Use `--include-drafts` only for planning previews; label those outputs as draft-inclusive.

If the script cannot run, perform the equivalent workflow directly: inventory authored frontmatter, apply the metadata contract, block unsafe rebuilds, and write the derived Markdown and JSON map only when safe or explicitly forced.

## Workflow

Run the doctor checks first. If blocking findings exist, stop unless the user explicitly accepts a forced projection. Rebuild from authored frontmatter only: work archives, feature archives, and living ledgers. Do not read an existing governance map as source truth.

Write these generated artifacts under `reporting_output_path`:

- `governance-map.json`
- `governance-map.md`

Every generated artifact must identify itself as derived, list source paths, include the doctor status, preserve blocking/advisory counts, and include `generated_at`.

## Output Contract

End with the doctor status, generated paths, entity count, blocking/advisory counts, and whether drafts were included. Include a fenced JSON summary with `module`, `report_type`, `status`, `json_path`, `markdown_path`, `entity_count`, `blocking_count`, `advisory_count`, and `include_drafts`.

## Safety Rules

Never edit work archives, feature archives, service/domain/program ledgers, or existing authored topology decisions. Generated maps are disposable projections; if they conflict with authored sources, fix the authored sources or rerun `ausx-lens-doctor` before rebuilding.
