# Lens Doctor

## Overview

This skill runs lightweight Lens health checks against authored work archives, feature archives, and living ledgers. Act as a topology triage reviewer: separate projection-blocking defects from draft advisories and route the user to the next workflow that can fix or explain the finding.

## On Activation

Load available config from `{project-root}/_bmad/config.yaml`, `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.yaml`, `{project-root}/_bmad/config.toml`, and `{project-root}/_bmad/config.user.toml`, checking root values and the `lens` or `modules.lens` section. Use these defaults:

- `work_intake_path`: `{project-root}/docs/features`
- `feature_archive_path`: `{project-root}/docs/features`
- `landscape_root`: `{project-root}/docs`
- `reporting_output_path`: `{project-root}/_bmad-output/lens`
- `freshness_threshold_hours`: `24`
- `lens_mode`: `auto`

Use the shared metadata contract at `{project-root}/skills/lens-setup/assets/metadata-schema.md`. Run `lens-preflight` first when Lens context or governance repo readiness matters. If local execution is available, run:

```bash
python {project-root}/skills/lens-projection-rebuild/scripts/lens_projection.py doctor {project-root} --work-intake-path {work_intake_path} --feature-archive-path {feature_archive_path} --landscape-root {landscape_root}
```

If the script cannot run, perform the same checks directly from the metadata contract.

## Doctor Lens

Blocking findings prevent published projection rebuilds: duplicate published stable IDs, missing required metadata, invalid stable ID prefixes, broken `belongs_to`, parent type mismatches, parent cycles, broken local links, and completed published features with no resolvable ledger target.

Advisory findings include draft parent gaps, completed-but-unpromoted knowledge with a valid parent, Salmon signals that need recursive review, stale timestamps, and metadata cleanup that does not make projections unsafe.

When optional Lens context fields are present, also validate that the track is recognized, the phase belongs to the track, `lens_docs_path` exists, and Lens preflight or constitution statuses are not blocked. These checks are clean-room consistency checks over Lens metadata; they do not replace Lens phase validation or constitution resolution.

## Output Contract

Produce a compact doctor report with scope, source paths, blocking findings, advisory findings, projection rebuild readiness, and next workflow routing. Return or include JSON with `module`, `report_type: lens_doctor`, `status`, `entity_count`, `blocking_count`, `advisory_count`, `projection_rebuild_ready`, and `findings`.

## Routing

- Metadata or parentage blockers: fix source docs or run `lens-topology-design`.
- Completed unpromoted knowledge: run `lens-ledger-promotion` after blockers are resolved.
- Salmon signals: run `lens-salmon-impact`.
- Clean doctor status: run `lens-projection-rebuild`, then `lens-reporting-snapshot`.

## Safety Rules

Lens doctor is read-only. Never edit archives, ledgers, projections, or config files during a doctor run. If an obvious fix exists, describe it with exact source paths and route to the owning workflow.
